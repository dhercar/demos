<h3>Context <i class="fa fa-map-marked-alt"></i></h3>
<p>This post is inspired by an assignment I did with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaniszentnermurlans/?originalSubdomain=es">Yanis Zentner</a> during my <a href="https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/estudis/oferta_formativa/master_universitari/fitxa/E/M2203/index.html">MS in Ecology</a>. We were ask to submit an abstract and prepare a talk pretending we were in a scientific congress about biotic interactions. Inspired by <span class="citation">McCann (<a href="#ref-mccann2000diversity" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span> , we decided to investigate about the relationship between interactions and ecosystem stability. We were supposed to do some bibliographic research, which we did, but I couldn’t stand the chance of replicating and manipulating the simulations I was reading about.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When a natural ecosystem is free from perturbation it reaches a stable state where every species abundance stays the same… or does it???</p>
