### Context <i class="fa fa-map-marked-alt"></i>
This post is inspired by an assignment I did with [Yanis Zentner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaniszentnermurlans/?originalSubdomain=es) during my  [MS in Ecology](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/estudis/oferta_formativa/master_universitari/fitxa/E/M2203/index.html).  We were ask to submit an abstract and prepare a talk pretending we were in a scientific congress about biotic interactions. Inspired by @mccann2000diversity , we decided to investigate about the relationship between interactions and ecosystem stability. We were supposed to do some bibliographic research, which we did, but I couldn't stand the chance of replicating and manipulating the simulations I was reading about.


## Introduction

When a natural ecosystem is free from perturbation it reaches a stable state where every species abundance stays the same... or does it???
